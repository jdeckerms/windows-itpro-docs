# Deploy and enable Windows Defender Antivirus


**Applies to:**

- Windows 10

**Audience**

- Network administrators
- IT administrators


Depending on the management tool you are using, you may need to specifically enable or configure Windows Defender AV protection.

See the table in the [Deploy, manage, and report on Windows Defender AV](deploy-manage-report-windows-defender-antivirus.md#ref2) topic for instructions on how to enable protection with System Center Configuration Manager, Group Policy, Active Directory, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, PowerShell cmdlets, and Windows Management Instruction (WMI).

Some scenarios require additional guidance on how to successfully deploy or configure Windows Defender AV protection, such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments.

The remaining topic in this section provides end-to-end advice and best practices for [setting up Windows Defender AV ion virtual machines (VMs) in a VDI or Remote Desktop Services (RDS) environment](deployment-vdi-windows-defender-antivirus.md).
