# Windows Defender Antivirus in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016

Windows Defender Antivirus is a built-in antimalware solution that provides security and antimalware management for desktops, portable computers, and servers.

This library of documentation is aimed for enterprise security administrators who are either considering deployment, or have already deployed and are wanting to manage and configure Windows Defender AV on PC endpoints in their network.

For more important information about running Windows Defender on a server platform, see [Windows Defender Antivirus on Windows Server 2016](windows-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server-2016.md).

Windows Defender AV can be managed with:
- System Center Configuration Manager (as System Center Endpoint Protection, or SCEP) 
- Microsoft Intune

It can be configured with:
- System Center Configuration Manager (as System Center Endpoint Protection, or SCEP) 
- Microsoft Intune
- PowerShell
- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
- Group Policy

Some of the highlights of Windows Defender AV include:
- [Cloud-delivered protection](utilize-microsoft-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) for near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats
- [Always-on scanning](configure-real-time-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md), using advanced file and process behavior monitoring and other heuristics (also known as "real-time protection")
- [Dedicated protection updates](manage-updates-baselines-windows-defender-antivirus.md) based on machine-learning, human and automated big-data analysis, and in-depth threat resistance research


>[!TIP]
>You can also visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the following features are working and see how they work:
>- Cloud-delivered protection
>- Fast learning (including Black at first sight)
>- Potentially unwanted application blocking

## Minimum system requirements

Windows Defender AV has the same hardware requirements as Windows 10. For more information, see:
-   [Minimum hardware requirements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915086.aspx)
-   [Hardware component guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915049.aspx)


Some features require a certain version of Windows 10 - the minimum version required is specified at the top of each topic.

Functionality, configuration, and management is largely the same when using Windows Defender AV on Windows Server 2016, however [there are some differences](windows-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server-2016.md).
