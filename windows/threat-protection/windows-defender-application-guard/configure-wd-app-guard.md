# Configure Windows Defender Application Guard policy settings

**Applies to:**
- WindowsÂ 10 Enterpise edition, version 1709

Windows Defender Application Guard (Application Guard) works with Group Policy to help you manage your organization's computer settings. By using Group Policy, you can configure a setting once, and then copy it onto many computers. For example, you can set up multiple security settings in a GPO, which is linked to a domain, and then apply all those settings to every computer in the domain.

Application Guard uses both network isolation and application-specific settings.

### Network isolation settings
These settings, located at **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Network Isolation**, help you define and manage your company's network boundaries. Application Guard uses this information to automatically transfer any requests to access the non-corporate resources into the Application Guard container.

>[!NOTE]
>You must configure either the Enterprise resource domains hosted in the cloud or Private network ranges for apps settings on your employee devices to successfully turn on Application Guard using enterprise mode.
