# List of enlightened Microsoft apps for use with Windows Information Protection (WIP)

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1607 and later
- Windows 10 Mobile, version 1607 and later

Learn the difference between enlightened and unenlightened apps, and then review the list of enlightened apps provided by Microsoft along with the text you will need to use to add them to your allowed apps list.

## Enlightened versus unenlightened apps
Apps can be enlightened or unenlightened:

-   **Enlightened apps** can differentiate between corporate and personal data, correctly determining which to protect, based on your policies.

-   **Unenlightened apps** consider all data corporate and encrypt everything. Typically, you can tell an unenlightened app because:

    -   Windows Desktop shows it as always running in enterprise mode.

    -   Windows **Save As** experiences only allow you to save your files as enterprise.

- **WIP-work only apps** are unenlightened line-of-business apps that have been tested and deemed safe for use in an enterprise with WIP and Mobile App Management (MAM) solutions. 

## List of enlightened Microsoft apps
Microsoft has made a concerted effort to enlighten several of our more popular apps, including the following:

- Microsoft Edge

- Internet Explorer 11

- Microsoft People

- Mobile Office apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook Mail and Calendar

- Office 365 ProPlus apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook

- OneDrive app

- OneDrive sync client (OneDrive.exe, the next generation sync client)

- Microsoft Photos

- Groove Music

- Notepad

- Microsoft Paint

- Microsoft Movies & TV

- Microsoft Messaging

- Microsoft Remote Desktop

## List of WIP-work only apps from Microsoft
Microsoft still has apps that are unenlightened, but which have been tested and deemed safe for use in an enterprise with WIP and MAM solutions.

- Skype for Business
