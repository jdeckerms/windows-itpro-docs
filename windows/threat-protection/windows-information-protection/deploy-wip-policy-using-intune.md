# Deploy your Windows Information Protection (WIP) policy using the classic console for Microsoft Intune
**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1607 and later

After you’ve created your Windows Information Protection (WIP) policy, you'll need to deploy it to your organization's enrolled devices. Enrollment can be done for business or personal devices, allowing the devices to use your managed apps and to sync with your managed content and information.

**To deploy your WIP policy**

1.  On the **Configuration policies** page, locate your newly-created policy, click to select it, and then click the **Manage Deployment** button.
