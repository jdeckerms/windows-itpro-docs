Windows Defender ATP provides a centralized security operations experience for Windows as well as non-Windows platforms. You'll be able to see alerts from various supported operating systems (OS) in the Windows Defender ATP portal and better protect your organization's network. This experience leverages on a third-party security productsâ€™ sensor data. 

You'll need to know the exact Linux distros and Mac OS X versions that are compatible with Windows Defender ATP for the integration to work. 

## Onboard non-Windows endpoints
You'll need to take the following steps to oboard non-Windows endpoints:
1. Turn on third-party integration
2. Run a detection test

### Turn on third-party integration

1. In Windows Defender Security Center portal, select **Endpoint management** > **Clients** > **Non-Windows**. Make sure the third-party solution is listed.

2. 	Toggle the third-party provider switch button to turn on the third-party solution integration.

3. 	Click **Generate access token** button and then **Copy**.

4. 	Depending on the third-party implementation you're using, the implementation might vary. Refer to the third-party solution documentation for guidance on how to use the token.


>[!WARNING] 
>The access token has a limited validity period. If needed, regenerate the token close to the time you need to share it with the third-party solution.

### Run detection test
Create an EICAR test file by saving the string displayed on the portal in an empty text file. Then, introduce the test file to a machine running the third-party antivirus solution. 

The file should trigger a detection and a corresponding alert on Windows Defender ATP.

### Offboard non-Windows endpoints
To effectively offboard the endpoints from the service, you'll need to disable the data push on the third-party portal first then switch the toggle to off in Windows Defender Security Center. The toggle in the portal only blocks the data inbound flow.


1. Follow the third-party documentation to opt-out on the third-party service side.

2. In Windows Defender Security Center portal, select **Endpoint management**> **Non-Windows**.

3. Toggle the third-party provider switch button to turn stop telemetry from endpoints. 

>[!WARNING]
>If you decide to turn on the third-party integration again after disabling the integration, you'll need to regenerate the token and reapply it on endpoints.
