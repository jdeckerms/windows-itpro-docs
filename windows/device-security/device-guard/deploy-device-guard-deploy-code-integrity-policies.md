To increase the protection for devices that meet certain hardware requirements, you can use virtualization-based security (VBS) with your code integrity policies.
- For requirements, see [Hardware, firmware, and software requirements for Windows Defender Device Guard](requirements-and-deployment-planning-guidelines-for-device-guard.md#hardware-firmware-and-software-requirements-for-windows-defender-device-guard) in "Requirements and deployment planning guidelines for Windows Defender Device Guard."
