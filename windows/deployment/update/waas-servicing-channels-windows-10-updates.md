## Assign devices to Semi-Annual Channel

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Due to [naming changes](waas-overview.md#naming-changes), older terms like CB,CBB and LTSB may still be displayed in some of our products.
>
>In the following settings CB refers to Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted), while CBB refers to Semi-Annual Channel.

**To assign a single PC locally to CBB**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Update & security** > **Windows Update** > **Advanced options**.
2. Select **Defer feature updates**.

**To assign PCs to CBB using Group Policy**

- In Windows 10, version 1511:

    Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > **Defer Upgrades and Updates**

- In Windows 10, version 1607:

    Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Defer Windows Updates > **Select when Feature Updates are received** - enable policy and set branch readiness level to CBB
    
**To assign PCs to CBB using MDM**

- In Windows 10, version 1511:

    ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/**RequireDeferUpgrade**

- In Windows 10, version 1607:

    ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/**BranchReadinessLevel**
    
**To assign Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise to CBB using MDM**

- In Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise, version 1511:

    ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/RequireDeferUpgrade

- In Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise, version 1607:

    ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/BranchReadinessLevel

## Enroll devices in the Windows Insider Program

To get started with the Windows Insider Program for Business, you will need to follow a few simple steps:

1. On the [Windows Insider](https://insider.windows.com) website, go to **For Business > Getting Started** to [register your organizational Azure AD account](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/insidersigninaad/).
2. **Register your domain**. Rather than have each user register individually for Insider Preview builds, administrators can simply [register their domain](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/for-business-organization-admin/) and control settings centrally.</br>**Note:** The signed-in user needs to be a **Global Administrator** of the Azure AD domain in order to be able to register the domain.
3. Make sure the **Allow Telemetry** setting is set to **2** or higher.
4. Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, set policies to manage preview builds and their delivery:

The **Manage preview builds** setting gives administrators control over enabling or disabling preview build installation on a device. You can also decide to stop preview builds once the release is public.
* Group Policy: **Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update/Windows Update for Business** - *Manage preview builds*
* MDM: **Update/ManagePreviewBuilds**

The **Branch Readiness Level** settings allows you to choose between preview flight rings, and allows you to defer or pause the delivery of updates.
* Group Policy: **Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update/ Windows Update for Business** - *Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received*
* MDM: **Update/BranchReadinessLevel**

For more information, see [Windows Insider Program for Business](waas-windows-insider-for-business.md)

## Block access to Windows Insider Program

To prevent devices in your enterprise from being enrolled in the Insider Program for early releases of Windows 10:

- Group Policy: Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Data Collection and Preview Builds\\**Toggle user control over Insider builds**
- MDM: Policy CSP - [System/AllowBuildPreview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn904962%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#System_AllowBuildPreview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, this policy is replaced by **Manage preview builds** policy.
> * Group Policy: **Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update/Windows Update for Business** - *Manage preview builds*
> * MDM: **Update/ManagePreviewBuilds**


## Switching channels

During the life of a device, it may be necessary or desirable to switch between the available channels. Depending on the channel you are using, the exact mechanism for doing this can be different; some will be simple, others more involved.

## Block user access to Windows Update settings

In Windows 10, administrators can control user access to Windows Update.
By enabling the Group Policy setting under **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows update\Remove access to use all Windows update features**, administrators can disable the "Check for updates" option for users. Any background update scans, downloads and installations will continue to work as configured.

>[!NOTE]
> In Windows 10, any Group Policy user configuration settings for Windows Update were deprecated and are no longer supported on this platform.
