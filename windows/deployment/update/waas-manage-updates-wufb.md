# Deploy updates using Windows Update for Business


**Applies to**

- WindowsÂ 10
- Windows 10 Mobile

> **Looking for consumer information?** See [Windows Update: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12373/windows-update-faq) 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Due to [naming changes](waas-overview.md#naming-changes), older terms like CB,CBB and LTSB may still be displayed in some of our products.
>
>In the following settings CB refers to Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted), while CBB refers to Semi-Annual Channel. 

Windows Update for Business enables information technology administrators to keep the Windows 10 devices in their organization always up to date with the latest security defenses and Windows features by directly connecting these systems to Windows Update service.  You can use Group Policy or MDM solutions such as Intune to configure the Windows Update for Business settings that control how and when Windows 10 devices are updated. In addition, by using Intune, organizations can manage devices that are not joined to a domain at all or are joined to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) alongside your on-premises domain-joined machines.  

Specifically, Windows Update for Business allows for: 

- The creation of deployment rings, where administrators can specify which devices go first in an update wave, and which ones will come later (to ensure any quality bars are met).
- Selectively including or excluding drivers as part of Microsoft-provided updates
- Integration with existing management tools such as Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), System Center Configuration Manager, and Microsoft Intune.
- Peer-to-peer delivery for Microsoft updates, which optimizes bandwidth efficiency and reduces the need for an on-site server caching solution.

Windows Update for Business is a free service that is available for Windows Pro, Enterprise, Pro Education, and Education.

## Update types

Windows Update for Business provides three types of updates to Windows 10 devices:

- **Feature Updates**: previously referred to as *upgrades*, Feature Updates contain not only security and quality revisions, but also significant feature additions and changes; they are released semi-annually.
- **Quality Updates**: these are traditional operating system updates, typically released the second Tuesday of each month (though they can be released at any time).  These include security, critical, and driver updates. Windows Update for Business also treats non-Windows updates (such as those for Microsoft Office or Visual Studio) as Quality Updates. These non-Windows Updates are known as *Microsoft Updates* and devices can be optionally configured to receive such updates along with their Windows Updates.
- **Non-deferrable updates**: Currently, antimalware and antispyware Definition Updates from Windows Update cannot be deferred.
 
Both Feature and Quality Updates can be deferred from deploying to client devices by a Windows Update for Business administrator within a bounded range of time from when those updates are first made available on the Windows Update Service. This deferral capability allows administrators to validate deployments as they are pushed to all client devices configured for Windows Update for Business.

| Category | Maximum deferral | Deferral increments | Example | Classification GUID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feature Updates | 365 days | Days | From Windows 10, version 1511 to version 1607 maximum was 180 days</br>In Windows 10, version 1703 maximum is 365 | 3689BDC8-B205-4AF4-8D4A-A63924C5E9D5 |
| Quality Updates | 30 days | Days | Security updates</br>Drivers (optional)</br>Non-security updates</br>Microsoft updates (Office,Visual Studio, etc.) | 0FA1201D-4330-4FA8-8AE9-B877473B6441</br>EBFC1FC5-71A4-4F7B-9ACA-3B9A503104A0</br>CD5FFD1E-E932-4E3A-BF74-18BF0B1BBD83</br>varies |
| Non-deferrable | No deferral | No deferral | Definition updates | E0789628-CE08-4437-BE74-2495B842F43B |

## Changes to Windows Update for Business in Windows 10, version 1709

The group policy path for Windows Update for Business was changed to correctly reflect its association to Windows Update for Business.

| Prior to Windows 10, version 1709 | Windows 10, version 1709 |
| --- | --- |
| Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Defer Windows Update | Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Windows Update for Business | 

We have added the ability to manage Windows Insider preview builds and their delivery:

The **Manage preview builds** setting gives administrators control over enabling or disabling preview build installation on a device. You can also decide to stop preview builds once the release is public.
* Group Policy: **Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update/Windows Update for Business** - *Manage preview builds*
* MDM: **Update/ManagePreviewBuilds**

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This policy replaces the "Toggle user control over Insider builds" policy under that is only supported up to Windows 10, version 1703. You can find the older policy here:
>* Group Policy: **Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Data Collection and Preview Builds/Toggle user control over Insider builds**
>* MDM: **System/AllowBuildPreview**

The policy settings to **Select when Feature Updates are received** is now called **Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received**. In addition to previous functionality, it now allows you to choose between preview flight rings, and allows you to defer or pause their delivery.
* Group Policy: **Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update/ Windows Update for Business** - *Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received*
* MDM: **Update/BranchReadinessLevel**

## Changes to Windows Update for Business in Windows 10, version 1703

### Options added to Settings

We have added a few controls into settings to allow users to control Windows Update for Business through an interface. 
- [Configuring the device's branch readiness level](waas-configure-wufb.md#configure-devices-for-current-branch-or-current-branch-for-business), through **Settings > Update & security > Windows Update > Advanced options**
- [Pausing feature updates](waas-configure-wufb.md#pause-feature-updates), through **Settings > Update & security > Window Update > Advanced options**

### Adjusted time periods

We have adjusted the maximum pause period for both quality and feature updates to be 35 days, as opposed to 30 and 60 days previously, respectively.

We have also adjusted the maximum feature update deferral period to be 365 days, as opposed to 180 days previously.

### Additional changes

The pause period is now calculated starting from the set start date. For additional details, see [Pause Feature Updates](waas-configure-wufb.md#pause-feature-updates) and [Pause Quality Updates](waas-configure-wufb.md#pause-quality-updates). Due to that, some policy keys are now named differently. For more information, see [Comparing the version 1607 keys to the version 1703 keys](waas-configure-wufb.md#comparing-the-version-1607-keys-to-the-version-1703-keys).

## Comparing Windows Update for Business in Windows 10, version 1511 and version 1607

## Monitor Windows Updates using Update Compliance

Update Compliance, now **available in public preview**, provides a holistic view of OS update compliance, update deployment progress, and failure troubleshooting for WindowsÂ 10 devices. This new service uses telemetry data including installation progress, Windows Update configuration, and other information to provide such insights, at no extra cost and without additional infrastructure requirements. Whether used with Windows Update for Business or other management tools, you can be assured that your devices are properly updated.
