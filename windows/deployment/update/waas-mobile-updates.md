Configuration of Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 IoT Mobile devices is limited to the feature set pertaining to Quality Updates only. That is, Windows Mobile Feature Updates are categorized the same as Quality Updates, and can only be deferred by setting the Quality Update deferral period, for a maximum period of 30 days. You can use mobile device management (MDM) to manage updates for Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise and Windows 10 IoT Mobile. Updates cannot be managed for Windows 10 Mobile. 

## Windows 10, version 1511

Only the following Windows Update for Business policies are supported for Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 IoT Mobile:

- ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/RequireDeferredUpgrade
- ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/DeferUpdatePeriod
- ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/PauseDeferrals

To defer the update period or pause deferrals, the device must be configured for CBB servicing branch by applying the **RequireDeferredUpgrade** policy.

## Windows 10, version 1607

Only the following Windows Update for Business policies are supported for Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 IoT Mobile:

- ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/BranchReadinessLevel
- ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/DeferQualityUpdatesInDays  
- ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/PauseQualityUpdates

In version 1607, you can defer and pause updates for devices on both the CB and CBB servicing branches.

If a device running Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise or Windows 10 IoT Mobile, version 1511, has Windows Update for Business policies applied and is then updated to version 1607, version 1511 policies continue to apply until version 1607 policies are applied.
