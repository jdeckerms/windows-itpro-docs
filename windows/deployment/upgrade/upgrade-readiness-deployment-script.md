# Upgrade Readiness deployment script

To automate the steps provided in [Get started with Upgrade Readiness](upgrade-readiness-get-started.md), and to troubleshoot data sharing issues, you can run the [Upgrade Readiness deployment script](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=822966&clcid=0x409), developed by Microsoft.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Upgrade Readiness was previously called Upgrade Analytics. References to Upgrade Analytics in any scripts or online content pertain to the Upgrade Readiness solution.

For detailed information about using the Upgrade Readiness (also known as upgrade analytics) deployment script, see the [Upgrade Analytics blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/upgradeanalytics/2016/09/20/new-version-of-the-upgrade-analytics-deployment-script-available/).

> The following guidance applies to version 11.11.16 or later of the Upgrade Readiness deployment script. If you are using an older version, download the latest from the [Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=822966&clcid=0x409).

The Upgrade Readiness deployment script does the following:

1.  Sets commercial ID key + CommercialDataOptIn + RequestAllAppraiserVersions keys.
2.  Verifies that user computers can send data to Microsoft.
3.  Checks whether the computer has a pending restart.  
4.  Verifies that the latest version of KB package 10.0.x is installed (version 10.0.14348 or later is required, but version 10.0.14913 or later is recommended).
5.  If enabled, turns on verbose mode for troubleshooting.
6.  Initiates the collection of the telemetry data that Microsoft needs to assess your organization’s upgrade readiness.
7.  If enabled, displays the script’s progress in a cmd window, providing you immediate visibility into issues (success or fail for each step) and/or writes to log file.

To run the Upgrade Readiness deployment script:

1.  Download the [Upgrade Readiness deployment script](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=822966&clcid=0x409) and extract the .zip file. Inside, there are two folders: **Pilot** and **Deployment**. The **Pilot** folder contains advanced logging that can help troubleshoot issues and is intended to be run from an elevated command prompt. The **Deployment** folder offers a lightweight script intended for broad deployment through ConfigMgr or other software deployment system. We recommend manually running the Pilot version of the script on 5-10 machines to verify that everything is configured correctly. Once you have confirmed that data is flowing successfully, proceed to run the Deployment version throughout your organization.

2.  Edit the following parameters in RunConfig.bat:

    1.  Provide a storage location for log information. You can store log information on a remote file share or a local directory. If the script is blocked from creating the log file for the given path, it creates the log files in the drive with the Windows directory. Example: %SystemDrive%\\UADiagnostics

    2.  Input your commercial ID key. This can be found in your OMS workspace under Settings -> Connected Sources -> Windows Telemetry.

    3.  By default, the script sends log information to both the console and the log file. To change the default behavior, use one of the following options:

        > *logMode = 0 log to console only*
        >
        > *logMode = 1 log to file and console*
        >
        > *logMode = 2 log to file only*

3.  To enable Internet Explorer data collection, set AllowIEData to IEDataOptIn. By default, AllowIEData is set to Disable. Then use one of the following options to determine what Internet Explorer data can be collected:

    > *IEOptInLevel = 0 Internet Explorer data collection is disabled*
    >
    > *IEOptInLevel = 1 Data collection is enabled for sites in the Local intranet + Trusted sites + Machine local zones*
    >
    > *IEOptInLevel = 2 Data collection is enabled for sites in the Internet + Restricted sites zones*
    >
    > *IEOptInLevel = 3 Data collection is enabled for all sites*

4. The latest version (03.02.17) of the deployment script is configured to collect and send diagnostic and debugging data to Microsoft. If you wish to disable sending diagnostic and debugging data to Microsoft, set **AppInsightsOptIn = false**. By default, **AppInsightsOptIn** is set to **true**.

    The data that is sent is the same data that is collected in the text log file that captures the events and error codes while running the script. This file is named in the following format: **UA_yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_ss_machineID.txt**. Log files are created in the drive that is specified in the RunConfig.bat file. By default this is set to: **%SystemDrive%\UADiagnostics**.

    This data gives us the ability to determine the status of your machines and to help troubleshoot issues. If you choose to opt-in to and send this data to Microsoft, you must also allow https traffic to be sent to the following wildcard endpoints:

    \*vortex\*.data.microsoft.com<BR>
    \*settings\*.data.microsoft.com

5.  After you finish editing the parameters in RunConfig.bat, you are ready to run the script. If you are using the Pilot version, run RunConfig.bat from an elevated command prompt. If you are using the Deployment version, use ConfigMgr or other software deployment service to run RunConfig.bat as system.

The deployment script displays the following exit codes to let you know if it was successful, or if an error was encountered.

The log file is named with the format **UA_yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_ss_machineID.txt**. There will be some additional logs generated under your **<system drive>\Windows\Temp** directory with the names similar to **AslLog_....txt**. You should send those logs as well.
