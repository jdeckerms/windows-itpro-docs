# Validate and Deploy Multifactor Authentication Services (MFA)

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10

> This guide only applies to Windows 10, version 1703 or higher.

Windows Hello for Business requires all users perform multi-factor authentication prior to creating and registering a Windows Hello for Business credential.  Windows Hello for Business deployments use Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (Azure MFA) services for the secondary authentication.  On-Premises deployments use Azure MFA server, an on-premises implementation that do not require synchronizing Active Directory credentials to Azure Active Directory.

Azure Multi-Factor Authentication is an easy to use, scalable, and reliable solution that provides a second method of authentication so your users are always protected.
* **Easy to Use** - Azure Multi-Factor Authentication is simple to set up and use. The extra protection that comes with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication allows users to manage their own devices. Best of all, in many instances it can be set up with just a few simple clicks.
* **Scalable** - Azure Multi-Factor Authentication uses the power of the cloud and integrates with your on-premises AD and custom apps. This protection is even extended to your high-volume, mission-critical scenarios.
* **Always Protected** - Azure Multi-Factor Authentication provides strong authentication using the highest industry standards.
* **Reliable** - We guarantee 99.9% availability of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. The service is considered unavailable when it is unable to receive or process verification requests for the two-step verification.

## On-Premises Azure MFA Server

On-premises deployments, both key and certificate trust, use the Azure MFA server where the credentials are not synchronized to Azure Active Directory.

### Infrastructure

A lab or proof-of-concept environment does not need high-availability or scalability.  However, a production environment needs both of these.  Ensure your environment considers and incorporates these factors, as necessary. All production environments should have a minimum of two MFA servers—one primary and one secondary server. The environment should have a minimum of two User Portal Servers that are load balanced using hardware or Windows Network Load Balancing.

Please follow [Download the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-server#download-the-azure-multi-factor-authentication-server) to download Azure MFA server. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure to validate the requirements for Azure MFA server, as outlined in [Install and Configure the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-server#install-and-configure-the-azure-multi-factor-authentication-server) before proceeding. Do not use instllation instructions provided in the article.

Once you have validated all the requirements, please proceed to [Configure or Deploy Multifactor Authentication Services](hello-cert-trust-deploy-mfa.md).
