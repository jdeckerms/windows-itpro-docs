# Configure kiosk and shared devices running Windows desktop editions

Some desktop devices in an enterprise serve a special purpose, such as a common PC in a touchdown space that any employee can sign in to, or a PC in the lobby that customers can use to view your product catalog. Windows 10 is easy to configure for shared use or for use as a kiosk (single app).
