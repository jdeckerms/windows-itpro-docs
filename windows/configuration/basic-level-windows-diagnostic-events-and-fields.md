# Windows 10, version 1703 basic level Windows diagnostic events and fields

 **Applies to**

- Windows 10, version 1703

The Basic level gathers a limited set of information that is critical for understanding the device and its configuration including: basic device information, quality-related information, app compatibility, and Microsoft Store. When the level is set to Basic, it also includes the Security level information. The Basic level also helps to identify problems that can occur on a particular device hardware or software configuration. For example, it can help determine if crashes are more frequent on devices with a specific amount of memory or that are running a particular driver version. This helps Microsoft fix operating system or app problems.

Use this article to learn about diagnostic events, grouped by event area, and the fields within each event. A brief description is provided for each field. Every event generated includes common data, which collects device data. You can learn more about Windows functional and diagnostic data through these articles:

- [Configure Windows telemetry in your organization](configure-windows-telemetry-in-your-organization.md)

>[!Note]
>Updated November 2017 to document new and modified events. We’ve added some new events and also added new fields to existing events to prepare for upgrades to the next release of Windows.

## Common data extensions

### Common Data Extensions.App

The following fields are available:

- **expId**  Associates a flight, such as an OS flight, or an experiment, such as a web site UX experiment, with an event.
- **userId**  The userID as known by the application.
- **env**  The environment from which the event was logged.

- **bseq**  Upload buffer sequence number in the format \<buffer identifier\>:\<sequence number\>
- **mon**  Combined monitor and event sequence numbers in the format \<monitor sequence\>:\<event sequence\>


### Common Data Extensions.Device

 

The following fields are available:

- **ver**  Represents the major and minor version of the extension.
- **localId**  Represents a locally defined unique ID for the device, not the human readable device name. Most likely equal to the value stored at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SQMClient\MachineId

### Common Data Extensions.Consent UI Event

This User Account Control (UAC) telemetry point collects information on elevations that originate from low integrity levels. This occurs when a process running at low integrity level (IL) requires higher (administrator) privileges, and therefore requests for elevation via UAC (consent.exe).

## Fault Reporting events

### Microsoft.Windows.FaultReporting.AppCrashEvent

This event sends data about crashes for both native and managed applications, to help keep Windows up to date. The data includes information about the crashing process and a summary of its exception record. It does not contain any Watson bucketing information. The bucketing information is recorded in a Windows Error Reporting (WER) event that is generated when the WER client reports the crash to the Watson service, and the WER event will contain the same ReportID (see field 14 of crash event, field 19 of WER event) as the crash event for the crash being reported. AppCrash is emitted once for each crash handled by WER (e.g. from an unhandled exception or FailFast or ReportException). Note that Generic Watson event types (e.g. from PLM) that may be considered crashes" by a user DO NOT emit this event.

AppHang is reported only on PC devices. It handles classic Win32 hangs and is emitted only once per report.
