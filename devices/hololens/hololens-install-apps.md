# Install apps on HoloLens

The recommended way to install Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps on HoloLens is to use Microsoft Store for Business. You can make your own [line-of-business application](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/manage/working-with-line-of-business-apps) available through Microsoft Store for Business.

You can also deploy apps using your mobile device management (MDM) provider or use the Windows Device Portal to install apps, if you enable **Developer Mode** on the HoloLens device.

>[!IMPORTANT]
    >When you set up HoloLens to use the Device Portal, you must enable **Developer Mode** on the device.**Developer Mode** on a device that has been upgraded to Windows Holographic for Business enables side-loading of apps, which risks the installation of apps that have not been certified by the Microsoft Store. Administrators can block the ability to enable **Developer Mode** using the **ApplicationManagement/AllowDeveloper Unlock** setting in the [Policy CSP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn904962.aspx). [Learn more about Developer Mode.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#developer-mode)

## Use Microsoft Store for Business to deploy apps to HoloLens

Microsoft Store for Business is a private Microsoft Store for your enterprise. People in your organization can open the Store app and select your private Store to install apps that you have made available to them.

In your Microsoft Store for Business dashboard, you can also download apps to distribute to devices that aren't connected to the Internet, plus add line-of-business (LOB) apps for distribution. 

### Requirements

- You need to be a global administrator for your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. 

    >[!TIP]
    >You can create an Azure AD account and tenant as part of the Store for Business sign-up process.
     
- End users need Azure AD accounts when they access Store for Business content from Windows-based devices.

### Install apps on HoloLens from Microsoft Store for Business

| Distribution method | To install on HoloLens|
| --- | --- |
| Using private store | Open the Store app and select the tab for your organization to choose from available apps.  |
| Using MDM | [You can configure MDM to synchronize your Store for Business inventory.](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/manage/distribute-apps-with-management-tool)  |



## Use MDM to deploy apps to HoloLens

You can deploy UWP apps to HoloLens using your MDM provider. For Intune instructions, see [Deploy apps in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/add-apps).

Using Intune, you can also [monitor your app deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/monitor-apps-in-microsoft-intune).


## Use the Windows Device Portal to install apps on HoloLens.
1. [Set up the HoloLens to use the Windows Device Portal](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/using_the_windows_device_portal#setting_up_hololens_to_use_windows_device_portal). The Device Portal is a web server on your HoloLens that you can connect to from a web browser on your PC. 

2. On a PC, connect to the HoloLens using [Wi-Fi](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/Using_the_Windows_Device_Portal.html#connecting_over_wi-fi) or [USB](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/Using_the_Windows_Device_Portal.html#connecting_over_usb).

3. [Create a user name and password](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/Using_the_Windows_Device_Portal.html#creating_a_username_and_password) if this is the first time you connect to the Windows Device Portal, or enter the user name and password that you previously set up.

    >[!TIP]
    >If you see a certificate error in the browser, follow [these troubleshooting steps](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/Using_the_Windows_Device_Portal.html#security_certificate).

4. In the Windows Device Portal, click **Apps**.
