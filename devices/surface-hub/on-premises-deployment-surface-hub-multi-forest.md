# On-premises deployment for Surface Hub in a multi-forest environment


This topic explains how you add a device account for your Microsoft Surface Hub when you have a multi-forest, on-premises deployment.

If you have a multi-forest on-premises deployment with Microsoft Exchange 2013 or later and Skype for Business 2013 or later, then you can [use the provided PowerShell scripts](appendix-a-powershell-scripts-for-surface-hub.md#create-on-premise-ps-scripts) to create device accounts. If you’re using a single-forest deployment, see [On-premises deployment for Surface Hub in a single-forest environment](on-premises-deployment-surface-hub-device-accounts.md).

1.  Start a remote PowerShell session from a PC and connect to Exchange.

    Be sure you have the right permissions set to run the associated cmdlets.

    Note here that `$strExchangeServer` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Exchange server, and `$strLyncFQDN` is the FQDN of your Skype for Business server.

    ```PowerShell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    $org='contoso.microsoft.com'
    $cred=Get-Credential $admin@$org
    $sessExchange = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName microsoft.exchange -Credential $cred -AllowRedirection -Authentication Kerberos -ConnectionUri "http://$strExchangeServer/powershell" -WarningAction SilentlyContinue
    $sessLync = New-PSSession -Credential $cred -ConnectionURI "https://$strLyncFQDN/OcsPowershell" -AllowRedirection -WarningAction SilentlyContinue
    Import-PSSession $sessExchange
    Import-PSSession $sessLync
    ```

2.  After establishing a session, create a new mailbox in the Resource Forest. This will allow the account to authenticate into the Surface Hub.

    If you're changing an existing resource mailbox:

    ```PowerShell
    New-Mailbox -UserPrincipalName HUB01@contoso.com -Alias HUB01 -Name "Hub-01"
    ```

3.  After setting up the mailbox, you will need to either create a new Exchange ActiveSync policy, or use a compatible existing policy.

    Surface Hubs are only compatible with device accounts that have an ActiveSync policy where the **PasswordEnabled** property is set to **False**. If this isn’t set properly, then Exchange services on the Surface Hub (mail, calendar, and joining meetings), will not be enabled.

    If you haven’t created a compatible policy yet, use the following cmdlet-—this one creates a policy called "Surface Hubs". Once it’s created, you can apply the same policy to other device accounts.

    ```PowerShell
    $easPolicy = New-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy -Name “SurfaceHubs” -PasswordEnabled $false
    ```

    Once you have a compatible policy, then you will need to apply the policy to the device account. 

    ```PowerShell
    Set-CASMailbox $acctUpn -ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy $easPolicy -ActiveSyncEnabled $true
    Set-Mailbox $acctUpn -Type Room
    ```

4.  Various Exchange properties can be set on the device account to improve the meeting experience for people. You can see which properties need to be set in the [Exchange properties](exchange-properties-for-surface-hub-device-accounts.md) section.

    ```PowerShell
    Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $acctUpn -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false –AllowConflicts $false –DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -RemovePrivateProperty $false
    Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $acctUpn -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse "This is a Surface Hub room!"
    ```

5.  If you decide to have the password not expire, you can set that with PowerShell cmdlets too. See [Password management](password-management-for-surface-hub-device-accounts.md) for more information. This should be set in the User Forest.

    ```PowerShell
    Set-AdUser $acctUpn -PasswordNeverExpires $true
    ```

6.  Enable the account in Active Directory so it will authenticate to the Surface Hub. This should be set in the User Forest.

    ```PowerShell
    Set-AdUser $acctUpn -Enabled $true
    ```

6. You now need to change the room mailbox to a linked mailbox:

    ```PowerShell
    $cred=Get-Credential AuthForest\LinkedRoomTest1
    Set-mailbox -Alias LinkedRoomTest1 -LinkedMasterAccount AuthForest\LinkedRoomTest1 -LinkedDomainController AuthForest-4939.AuthForest.extest.contoso.com -Name LinkedRoomTest1 -LinkedCredential $cred -Identity LinkedRoomTest1
    ```

7.  Enable the device account with Skype for Business by enabling your Surface Hub AD account on a Skype for Business Server pool:

    ```PowerShell
    Enable-CsMeetingRoom -SipAddress "sip:HUB01@contoso.com"
     -DomainController DC-ND-001.contoso.com -RegistrarPool LYNCPool15.contoso.com
     -Identity HUB01
    ```

    You'll need to use the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) address and domain controller for the Surface Hub, along with your own Skype for Business Server pool identifier and user identity.
