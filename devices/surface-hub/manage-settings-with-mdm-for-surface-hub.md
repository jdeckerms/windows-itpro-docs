# Manage settings with an MDM provider (Surface Hub)

Surface Hub and other Windows 10 devices allow IT administrators to manage settings and policies using a mobile device management (MDM) provider. A built-in management component communicates with the management server, so there is no need to install additional clients on the device. For more information, see [Windows 10 mobile device management](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn914769.aspx).

Surface Hub has been validated with Microsoftâ€™s first-party MDM providers:
- On-premises MDM with System Center Configuration Manager (beginning in version 1602)
- Hybrid MDM with System Center Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune
- Microsoft Intune standalone

You can also manage Surface Hubs using any third-party MDM provider that can communicate with Windows 10 using the MDM protocol.

>[!NOTE]
>[Azure Active Directory conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access) is not currently available for Surface Hub devices.

## <a href="" id="enroll-into-mdm"></a>Enroll a Surface Hub into MDM
You can enroll your Surface Hubs using bulk or manual enrollment.

> [!NOTE]
> You can join your Surface Hub to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to manage admin groups on the device. However, Surface Hub does not currently support automatic enrollment to Microsoft Intune through Azure AD join. If your organization automatically enrolls Azure AD-joined devices into Intune, you must disable this policy for Surface Hub before joining the device to Azure AD.
>
> **To enable automatic enrollment for Microsoft Intune**
> 1. In the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), navigate to the **Active Directory** node and select your directory. 
> 2. Click the **Applications** tab, then click **Microsoft Intune**.
> 3. Under **Manage devices for these users**, click **Groups**. 
> 4. Click **Select Groups**, then select the groups of users you want to automatically enroll into Intune. **Do not include accounts that are used to enroll Surface Hubs into Intune.**
> 5. Click the checkmark button, then click **Save**.

### Bulk enrollment
**To configure bulk enrollment**
- Surface Hub supports the [Provisioning CSP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt203665.aspx) for bulk enrollment into MDM. For more information, see [Windows 10 bulk enrollment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt613115.aspx).<br>
--OR--
- If you have an on-premises System Center Configuration Manager infrastructure, see [How to bulk enroll devices with On-premises Mobile Device Management in System Center Configuration Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt627898.aspx).

### Manual enrollment
**To configure manual enrollment**
1. On your Surface Hub, open **Settings**.
2. Type the device admin credentials when prompted.
3. Select **This device**, and navigate to **Device management**.
4. Under **Device management**, select **+ Device management**.
5. Follow the instructions in the dialog to connect to your MDM provider.

## Manage Surface Hub settings with MDM

You can use MDM to manage some [Surface Hub CSP settings](#supported-surface-hub-csp-settings), and some [Windows 10 settings](#supported-windows-10-settings). Depending on the MDM provider that you use, you may set these settings using a built-in user interface, or by deploying custom SyncML. Microsoft Intune and System Center Configuration Manager provide built-in experiences to help create policy templates for Surface Hub. Refer to documentation from your MDM provider to learn how to create and deploy SyncML.

### Supported Surface Hub CSP settings

You can configure the Surface Hub settings in the following table using MDM. The table identifies if the setting is supported with Microsoft Intune, System Center Configuration Manager, or SyncML.

For more information, see [SurfaceHub configuration service provider](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt608323).

### Generate OMA URIs for settings 
You need to use a settingâ€™s OMA URI to create a custom policy in Intune, or a custom setting in System Center Configuration Manager.

**To generate the OMA URI for any setting in the CSP documentation**
1. In the CSP documentation, identify the root node of the CSP. Generally, this looks like `./Vendor/MSFT/<name of CSP>` <br>
*For example, the root node of the [SurfaceHub CSP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt608323.aspx) is `./Vendor/MSFT/SurfaceHub`.*
2. Identify the node path for the setting you want to use. <br>
*For example, the node path for the setting to enable wireless projection is `InBoxApps/WirelessProjection/Enabled`.*
3. Append the node path to the root node to generate the OMA URI. <br>
*For example, the OMA URI for the setting to enable wireless projection is `./Vendor/MSFT/SurfaceHub/InBoxApps/WirelessProjection/Enabled`.*

The data type is also stated in the CSP documentation. The most common data types are:
- char (String)
- int (Integer)
- bool (Boolean)


<span id="example-intune">
## Example: Manage Surface Hub settings with Microsoft Intune

You can use Microsoft Intune to manage Surface Hub settings. 

**To create a configuration policy from a template**
