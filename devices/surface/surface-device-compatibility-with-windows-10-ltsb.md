# Surface device compatibility with Windows 10 Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB)

Surface devices are designed to provide best-in-class experiences in productivity and general-purpose scenarios. Regular updates enable Surface devices to bring to life new innovations and to evolve with the new capabilities delivered by Windows 10 Feature Updates. Feature Updates are available only in Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise editions that receive continuous updates through the Current Branch (CB) or Current Branch for Business (CBB) servicing options.

In contrast to the CB and CBB servicing options, you cannot select the Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) option in Windows 10 settings. To use the LTSB servicing option, you must install a separate edition of Windows 10 Enterprise, known as *Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB*. In addition to providing an extended servicing model, the Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB edition also provides an environment with several Windows components removed. The core Surface experiences that are impacted by LTSB include:

* Windows Feature Updates, including enhancements such as:

  *  Improvements to Direct Ink and palm rejection provided in Windows 10, version 1607 (also referred to as the Anniversary Update)
  *  Improved support for high DPI applications provided in Windows 10, version 1703 (also referred to as the Creators Update)

* Pressure sensitivity settings provided by the Surface app

* The Windows Ink Workspace

* Key touch-optimized in-box applications including Microsoft Edge, OneNote, Calendar, and Camera

The use of the Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB environment on Surface devices results in sub-optimal end-user experiences and you should avoid using it in environments where users want and expect a premium, up-to-date user experience.

The LTSB servicing option is designed for device types and scenarios where the key attribute is for features or functionality to never change. Examples include systems that power manufacturing or medical equipment, or embedded systems in kiosks, such as ATMs or airport ticketing systems.

>[!NOTE]
>For general information about Windows servicing branches, including LTSB, see [Overview of Windows as a service](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/update/waas-overview#long-term-servicing-branch).

>[!NOTE]
>As a general guideline, devices that fulfill the following criteria are considered general-purpose devices and should be paired with Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise using the CB or CBB servicing option:

* Devices that run productivity software such as Microsoft Office

* Devices that use Microsoft Store applications

* Devices that are used for general Internet browsing (for example, research or access to social media)

Before you choose to use Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB edition on Surface devices, consider the following limitations:

* Driver and firmware updates are not explicitly tested against releases of Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB. 

* If you encounter problems, Microsoft Support will provide troubleshooting assistance. However, due to the servicing nature of the Windows LTSB, issue resolution may require that devices be upgraded to a more recent version of Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB, or to Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise with the CB or CBB servicing option.

* Surface device replacements (for example, devices replaced under warranty) may contain subtle variations in hardware components that require updated device drivers and firmware. Compatibility with these updates may require the installation of a more recent version of Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB or Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise with the CB or CBB servicing option.

>[!NOTE]
>Organizations that standardize on a specific version of Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB may be unable to adopt new generations of Surface hardware without also updating to a later version of Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB or Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise. For more information, see the **How will Windows 10 LTSBs be supported?** topic in the **Supporting the latest processor and chipsets on Windows** section of [Lifecycle Policy FAQâ€”Windows products](https://support.microsoft.com/help/18581/lifecycle-policy-faq-windows-products#b4).

Surface devices running Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB edition will not receive new features. In many cases these features are requested by customers to improve the usability and capabilities of Surface hardware. For example, new improvements for High DPI applications in Windows 10, version 1703. Customers that use Surface devices in the LTSB configuration will not see the improvements until they either update to a new Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB release or upgrade to a version of Windows 10 with support for the CB and CBB servicing options.

Devices can be changed from Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB to a more recent version of Windows 10 Enterprise, with support for the CB and CBB servicing options, without the loss of user data by performing an upgrade installation. You can also perform an upgrade installation on multiple devices by leveraging the Upgrade Task Sequence Templates available in the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) and System Center Configuration Manager.
